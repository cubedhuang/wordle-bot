Guess the Word is a simple bot that lets you play the New York Times' Wordle in your Discord server!

Games are currently per-user, and multiple people can play a game in a channel at once. If you're already in a game, ${await command(
				c,
				"play"
			)} will resend your current game.

Guess the **secret word** in six tries! The word will be randomly chosen from the same list as the New York Times' Wordle answer list at the start of each game.

Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Use ${await command(
			c,
			"guess"
		)} to submit a guess.

After each guess, the color of the tiles will show how close your guess was to the word.

ðŸŸ©: The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
ðŸŸ¨: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
â¬›: The letter is not in the word.

If a letter appears more than once in the guess but only once in the word, only one of the two tiles will be yellow or green. If a letter appears twice in both the guess and the word, both tiles will be yellow or green depending on their position.
