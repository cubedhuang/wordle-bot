Guess the **Wordle** in six tries! The word will be randomly chosen from the offical Wordle answer list at the start of each game.

Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Use \`/guess\` to submit.

After each guess, the color of the tiles will show how close your guess was to the word.

ðŸŸ©: The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
ðŸŸ¨: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
â¬›: The letter is not in the word.

If a letter appears more than once in the guess but only once in the word, only one of the two tiles will be yellow or green. If a letter appears twice in both the guess and the word, both tiles will be yellow or green depending on their position.
