Wordle is a simple bot that lets you play Wordle in your Discord server!

Games are currently per-user, and multiple people can play a game in a channel at once. If you're already in a game, this will resend the current game state.

Wordle Bot is open source! You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/cubedhuang/wordle-bot).
We also have a [Terms of Service](https://gist.github.com/cubedhuang/2def1df2c9f1759bb8ec7c5084328618) and [Privacy Policy](https://gist.github.com/cubedhuang/c443f9b3692a4bd32b1bac6d566313b6).

Guess the **Wordle** in six tries! The word will be randomly chosen from the offical Wordle answer list at the start of each game.

Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Use ${await command(
			c,
			"guess"
		)} to submit.

After each guess, the color of the tiles will show how close your guess was to the word.

ðŸŸ©: The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
ðŸŸ¨: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
â¬›: The letter is not in the word.

If a letter appears more than once in the guess but only once in the word, only one of the two tiles will be yellow or green. If a letter appears twice in both the guess and the word, both tiles will be yellow or green depending on their position.
